# get-certified
A list of courses and resources for getting tech certifications. I used these resources and passed the certification tests on the first attempt. Circa mid-2020s.


## Terraform: [Associate](https://developer.hashicorp.com/certifications/infrastructure-automation)
* [Course on KodeKloud](https://learn.kodekloud.com/user/courses/terraform-basics-training-course) or [Udemy version of the same thing](https://wwt.udemy.com/course/terraform-for-the-absolute-beginners/)
* Practice exams (only) on ExamPro via [this course](https://www.exampro.co/terraform)


## Prometheus: [PCA](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/prometheus-certified-associate/)
* [Course on KodeKloud](https://learn.kodekloud.com/courses/prometheus-certified-associate-pca)
* [Practice exams on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/prometheus-certified-associate-practice-exam/)

NOTES:
  - taking the practice exams course listed just above will leave you in an over-prepared state, as IMO they were harder than the actual exam.
  - I can't say that I recommend getting this cert. It's fine but the others are more useful IMO.


## Vault: [Associate](https://developer.hashicorp.com/certifications/security-automation)
* [Course on KodeKloud](https://learn.kodekloud.com/user/courses/hashicorp-certified-vault-associate-certification)
* [Practice exams on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/hashicorp-certified-vault-associate-practice-exam/?couponCode=LETSLEARNNOW)

NOTES:
  - The guy who teaches the Vault course on KodeKloud is the same instructor as [this course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/hashicorp-vault). Probably the same content.
  - This course is thorough and detailed, sometimes to the point of tedium. Still, I found it to be a good intro course, even if you know little to nothing about Vault.

## AWS: [SAA](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate)
* [Course on KodeKloud](https://kodekloud.com/courses/aws-saa)
* Practice exams (only) on ExamPro via [this course](https://www.exampro.co/saa-c03)

NOTES:
  - Warning: The KodeKloud course for this cert is *long* and *thorough*. (Maybe too long?) There are a lot of example questions in the course video content that will help with practicing the art of identifying key phrases in the exam questions.
  - There are practice questions in the KodeKloud course, but I found the practice exams in ExamPro to be more helpful.

## Platform Engineering: [CNPA](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-cloud-native-platform-engineering-associate-cnpa/)
* [Course on KodeKloud](https://kodekloud.com/courses/certified-cloud-native-platform-engineering-associate-cnpa)

NOTES:
  - I have many years of experience in software development, including CI/CD, as well as recent experience/familiarity with DevOps, SRE, and GitOps concepts and patterns. In light of that, this was an easy exam to pass.
  - There are no detailed technical questions. This exam tests your familiarity with tools and concepts listed in the domains in the previous bullet.
