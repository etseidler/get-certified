# get-certified
list of courses and resources for getting tech certifications. circa 2023-2024


## Terraform
* [Course on KodeKloud](https://learn.kodekloud.com/user/courses/terraform-basics-training-course) or [Udemy version of the same thing](https://wwt.udemy.com/course/terraform-for-the-absolute-beginners/)
* Practice exams (only) on ExamPro via [this course](https://www.exampro.co/terraform)


## Prometheus
* [Course on KodeKloud](https://learn.kodekloud.com/courses/prometheus-certified-associate-pca)
* [Practice exams on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/prometheus-certified-associate-practice-exam/)

TBH, taking the practice exams course listed just above will leave you in an over-prepared state, as IMO they were harder than the actual exam.
